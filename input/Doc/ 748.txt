electron microscopic study developing gall 
bladder epithelium rabbit 
gall bladder epithelium 
adult rabbit consists two types cells. 
first common type shows features associated absorption, 
notably microvilli, limited pinocytosis, lysosomes elaboration 
lateral cell membrane intercellular spaces.  mitochondria 
concentrated subapical band. 
second infrequent type dark rod-shaped cell unknown 
function may dehydrated epithelial cell. 
foetal epithelial cells lack functional adult characteristics; mito- 
chondria uniformly distributed.  addition display basal granules 
apical apocrine bullae. 
epithelial cell damage white cell infiltration occurs 24 days 
birth just after. 
just birth epithelial cells large pale smooth 
outlines, others dense display vigorous pinocytosis. 
adult characteristics acquired immediately birth pino- 
cytosis subsides.  believed water resorption occurs 
functional changes allow continuous passage water 
circulation.
