platelet sequestration man . i. methods . 
  current methods labeling platelets chromium using 
ethylenediamine tetraacetate (edta) anticoagulant found 
cause rapid hepatic sequestration nearly transfused platelets 
50 returned circulation partially destroyed 
spleen . less one-third survived . evidence presented 
indicates edta injurious platelets . 
  acid-citrate medium buffered plasma ph 6.5 used 
anticoagulant, 36 85 labeled platelets survived (average, 
62 ), marked temporary sequestration occur . studies 
thrombocytopenic persons showed circulating platelet cr activity 
measures true survival transfused platelets . 
  survival sequestration platelets studied normal 
subjects . survival data support concept platelets die 
chiefly process senescence . external scintillation scanning 
various organs suggests normally majority platelets 
destroyed liver .
