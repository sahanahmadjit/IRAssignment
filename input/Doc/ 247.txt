tumor scanning radioactive cesium . 
  fourteen patients cancer scanned 10 minutes 48 hours 
injection radioactive cs. satisfactory scans tumors 
obtained seven . positive scans obtained large, 
superficial tumors, pulmonary lymphoma, carcinoma 
upper third esophagus . negative scans abdominal 
tumors . correlations made data obtained external 
counting well scintillation counting biopsy specimens . two 
modes uptake suggested.. (a) early uptake due vascularity 
probably proportional stable cesium content.. (b) later 
uptake based upon greater alkali metal content tumors normal 
tissue .
