histidinemia 
review published reports 
histidinemia indicates condition 
variability clinical biochemical 
expression.  three children histidinemia, 
born consanguineous marriage 
reported here.  blond hair, 
blue eyes, speech defects, mental retardation, 
peculiar eeg abnormality.  
also exhibited characteristic biochemical 
findings disease: elevated blood 
urine histidine, increased urine imidazolepyruvic 
acid, sustained high rise 
plasma histidine following oral histidine 
tolerance test.  not, however, 
reduction skin histidine a-deaminase 
activity observed 
children condition.  tests determination 
heterozygotes family 
successful. 
parental consanguinity normal skin 
a-deaminase activity set children apart 
reported cases.  first lends 
support hypothesis histidinemia 
inherited autosomal recessive trait; 
second supports idea genic 
fault results reduced histidine a- 
deaminase activity can expressed 
different degree different tissues.  
children seem represent variant 
histidinemia liver histidase activity 
reduced skin histidase activity
