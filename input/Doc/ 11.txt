electron-microscopic observatations transference fat 
human placenta . 
  results previous present studied 
transportation fat human placenta means electron 
microscopy, obtained following conclusions . 
  1) neutral fat can permeate human placenta without 
dissociation . 
  2) almost processes fat permeation seem due 
biological activity . pinocytosis representative, 
authors newly found several facts dissolution-like change 
basement membrane transport via stroma cell . authors 
believe results will bring clue explain mechanism 
biological transportation materials placenta .
