pathology 'giant cell hepatitis' early infancy. 
1-month-old male infant admitted 
hospital acute cardiac 
circulatory failure.  autopsy revealed macronodular 
liver cirrhosis splenomegaly, 
left ventricular dilatation heart, 
hydrothorax, ascites.  histology 
liver showed giant cell hepatitis.  
portal areas widened, foci 
erythropoiesis histiocytic infiltrations. 
liver cells showed vacuolar 
degenerative changes.  giant cells, present 
margin regeneration 
areas, well degenerated lobules 
irregular borders varied 
size 45-60 ft.  nuclei large, 
sometimes bizarre.  basophile 
cytoplasm showed granules iron pigment 
also found normal 
hepatic cells, prominent kupffer cells 
connective tissue.  
spleen proliferation connective 
tissue scattered areas erythropoiesis, 
well pigment deposits pulpa. 
iron pigment also found 
pancreas salivary glands.  islets 
langerhans hyperplastic.  etiology 
giant cell hepatitis still unknown. 
pathogenesis may due malformation, 
immunologic response type 
antibody, inborn errors iron 
metabolism viral infection.  suggested 
giant cell transformation 
response immature liver cell variety 
stimuli.  case interest 
predominance giant cells 1 
2 nuclei, presumably intermediate 
stage variant hepatitis.
