acetylcholinesterase 
part study investigate metal chelates possible reactivators 
phosphate poisoned acetylcholinesterase, shown chelates act 
inhibitors enzyme.  addition, copper nickel chelates 
2-pyridinealdoxime catalyze decomposition dfp sarin.  compared 
2-pam, however, chelates poor reactivators, probably 
improper alignment oxine oxygen chelate-enzyme complex.
