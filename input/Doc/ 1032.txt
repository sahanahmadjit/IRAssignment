femoral neuropathy hemophilia. 
   six new cases femoral neuropathy hemophilic 
patients described.  syndrome begins severe 
pain groin, inferior aspect thigh, 
deep hip region.  followed pronounced 
contracture hip flexion external 
rotation.  tender swelling appears iliac fossa 
groin depression center corresponding 
inguinal ligament.  finally, flaccid paralysis 
quadriceps femoris diminution absence sensation 
anteromedial aspect thigh proximal 
portion leg, depressed absent 
patellar reflex, discovered.  authors propose 
syndrome result hemorrhage iliopsoas 
muscle musculotendinous junction beneath 
iliacus fascia femoral nerve becomes 
compressed beneath unyielding inguinal ligament 
superiorly iliopectineal ligament medially. 
treatment consists bed rest, analgesics, freshfrozen 
plasma acute phase.  convalescent 
phase, hessing long brace used protect 
knee hemarthrosis functional return 
quadriceps femoris occurred.  date, 
validity theory femoral-nerve palsy 
result iliopsoas hemorrhage musculotendinous 
junction compression femoral nerve beneath 
inguinal ligament verified.  
authors anticipate day seeing non-hemophilic patient 
traumatic iliacus hemorrhage femoral 
neuropathy.  opportunity present itself, 
exploration beneath poupart's ligament may show 
femoral nerve compressed thus confirm 
proposed cause clinical picture.
