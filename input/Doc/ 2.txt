following facts.. 
  1. dna concentration 1100 ug p 15th day, decreases 
19th day reaches value 280 ug 5 days weaning . 
  2. rna concentration 1400 ug p 15th day decreases 820 
period . 
  3. pl concentration low 15th day foetal life (700 
ug) increases abruptly birth . 
  4. ratios rna cyto/dna pl cyto/dna increase regularly 
18th day foetal life . 
  5. nuclear rna pl contents high throughout 
development . 
  6. results enable us characterize three stages

foetal life.. stage growth hyperplasia without hypertrophy, 
  - 19th day foetal life 3rd day post-natal life,. 
stage cellular reorganisation, 
  - 3rd day post-natal life.. stage growth 
hyperplasia hypertrophy .
