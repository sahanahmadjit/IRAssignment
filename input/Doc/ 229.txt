patients breast cancer benign breast disease . 
  urinary levels neutral 17-ketosteroid fractions pregnanediol 
excreted 114 women, 56 premenopausal 58 postmenopausal, 
determined . subjects studied included 4 premenopausal groups 
(breast cancer 6, benign breast disease 18, sick control 8, well control 
24) 3 postmenopausal groups (breast cancer 21, sick control 17, well 
control 20) . 
  levels androsterone etiocholanolone excreted premenopausal 
patients breast cancer significantly less levels excreted 
premenopausal groups, differ significantly 
levels excreted postmenopausal patients breast cancer . 
  disproportionately lower levels 11-desoxy-17-ketosteroids 
11-oxy-17-ketosteroids excreted premenopausal patients cancer 
resulted significantly lower ratios found 
premenopausal groups . ratios associated premenopausal patients 
cancer differ significantly postmenopausal 
patients cancer . 
  lower levels androsterone etiocholanolone explained 
debilitation .
