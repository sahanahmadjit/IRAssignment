cardiac malformations associated ventricular septal defect . 
  study, 46 necropsy-proved cases ventricular septal defect 
associated another anomaly part recognized complex 
selected . 
  associated anomalies classified (1) obstructive 
positional anomalies great vessels, (2) anomalies responsible 
additional shunts, (3) anomalies causing intraventricular obstruction 
(4) aortic valvular insufficiency . 
  clinical findings often ventricular septal defect, 
findings related associated lesion frequently 
obscure . even special studies, including cardiac catheterization 
angiocardiography, often failure arrive complete 
diagnosis . findings led erroneous incomplete 
diagnosis presented . complete diagnosis made 
preoperatively, procedures leading outlined . 
diagnostic approach varies malformations may coexist 
ventricular septal defect, observed aortography 
selective left ventricular angiocardiography commonly helpful 
identifying occult malformations associated ventricular septal 
defect . therefore recommended complete studies, including 
left-sided cardiac catheterization left ventricular 
angiocardiography aortography, considered cases 
clinical, electrocardiographic, right-sided cardiac 
catheterization studies entirely typical isolated 
ventricular septal defect .
