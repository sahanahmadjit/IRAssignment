paper attempted clarify certain questions mechanism 
compensatory renal hypertrophy means histological, cytological, 
autoradiographical examinations nephrectomy experiments young grown 
rats.  based results investigation process compensatory 
renal hypertrophy must imagined follows: 
early two hours unilateral nephrectomy, distinct increase 
mitosis index without simultaneous increase dna-synthesizing cells 
observed remaining kidney.  assumed cell division 
polyploid cells involved, prolonged premitotic rest phase. 
latent period 48 hours, dna-synthesizing cells dividing 
cells start increase.  maximum regenerative processes reached 
3rd 4th day nephrectomy.  twenty days unilateral 
nephrectomy, regenerative processes largely concluded. 
tubule sections participate compensatory renal hypertrophy. 
although regenerative processes marked central section, 
one speak development actual indifference zone 
regenerating kidney. 
young test animals, compensatory renal hypertrophy determined 
mitotic cell division, older test animals polyploidization 
processes. 
results investigations provide certain indications 
assumption amitotic nuclear divisions play major part compensatory 
renal hypertrophy. 
proliferation processes extent localization run parallel 
regeneration parenchyma, also observed cells 
connective tissue renal vessels.
