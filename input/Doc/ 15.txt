lens development.. differentiation embryonic chick lens 
epithelial cells vitro vivo . 
  behavior lens epithelial cells six-day chick embryos 
studied three different experimental situations.. (a) explantation 
several different fluid culture media, (b) explantation followed 
reimplantation lensectomized embryonic eyes, (c) explantation 
followed reimplantation embryonic coelomic cavity . 
specimens examined histologically, total volume lens 
material specimen determined planimetry serial 
sections . results interpreted follows.. 
  1. small amount protein supplement culture medium, 
embryonic lens epithelial cells capable limited amount 
independent cytodifferentiation . without protein supplement fail 
undergo fiber formation . 
  2. returned eye environment, cultured epithelial explants 
will respond resumption growth, cellular 
differentiation, least morphogenetic changes 
necessary form lens . embryonic coelom will support 
responses . 
  3. initiation formation lens fibers sufficient 
complete autonomous maturation . 
  4. internal architecture developing lens 
determinant overall shape .
