diffusion chamber cultures . 
  radioautography tritiated thymidine utilized examine 
turnover rate origin small lymphocytes bone marrow 
guinea-pig . 
  marrow lymphocytes initially labeled single 
injection tritiated thymidine, thereafter number labeled 
lym phocytes rapidly increased high maximum levels 3 days . 
analysis labeling curves grain counts indicates 
population marrow lymphocytes maintained dynamic steady state 
average turnover time 3 days less . 
  suspensions bone marrow cells isolated circulation 
within intraperitoneal diffusion chambers short-term labeling 
tritiated thymidine vivo . although small lymphocytes 
labeled introduced diffusion chambers, considerable 
percentage became labeled subsequent culture period . 
  tritiated thymidine also administered intravenously whilst 
excluded one hind limb application occlusive 
compression bandage 20 minutes . labeled small lymphocytes 
found 72 hours tibial marrow initially occluded 
limb, whereas normal high percentage labeled control 
tibial marrow . 
  experiments demonstrate large-scale influx small 
lymphocytes blood stream marrow parenchyma . 
suggest newly formed small lymphocytes appear marrow 
result division locally situated precursor cells, 
mechanism intramedullary lymphocytopoiesis uncertain . 
/transitional/ cells, intermediate morphology blast cells 
small lymphocytes, synthesize dna actively proliferative,

  certain large, undifferentiated labeled cells appeared bone
