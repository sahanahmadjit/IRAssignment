cortisone atypical pulmonary /epithelial/ hyperplasia 
studies including electron microscopy, tissue culture, animal 
transplantation long term observations . 
  previous work rabbits showed proliferation 
cells within pulmonary alveoli following intratracheal injection 
nitric acid proliferation greatly enhanced 
administration cortisone animals . 
  electron microscopic observations indicated 
morphologically large alveolar lining cells . tissue culture studies 
damaged normal lung without cortisone showed evidence 
direct effect drug proliferation cells . 
  observation, together knowledge fibrosis 
delayed cortisone treated animals, support thesis 
cortisone effect indirect one . transplantation damaged lung 
tissue hamster cheek pouch failed reveal evidence growth . 
within period observation (99 420 days) evidence 
proliferation subsided considerably neoplasms developed
