comparison mutation inactivation rates induced bacteriophage 
transforming dna various mutagens . 
  inactivation mutation rates measured t4 phages 
bacillus subtilis transforming dna treated low ph, nitrous acid, 
hydroxylamine different temperatures . frequency mutants 
increased linearly time three agents, whereas logarithm 
survival gave linear plot nitrous acid low ph . 
arrhenius plot showed slopes inactivation mutation 
rates treatment low ph nitrous acid,. latter agent 
slope remained unaltered even dna treated 
denaturated state . contrast, mutation rates obtained 
exposure hydroxylamine differed greatly native denatured dna, 
phage t4 intermediate . 
  treatment low ph nitrous acid interrupted genetic linkage 
tryptophan histidine, interrupting hits 1/3 
frequent lethal hits, independent temperature .
