factors influencing development tumors frogs . 
  (1) study 75 spontaneous tumors vermont frogs showed three 
pathological grades malignancy present.. aggressive renal 
adenocarcinoma 30 per cent, medium adenocarcinoma 50 per 
cent, lower grade mixed tumors undetermined origin 
remaining 20 per cent . 
  (2) correlation parasite infections (trematodes) demonstrable 
cases kidney . hyperplasias neoplasias grading 
lung primary carcinoma found lung r. pipiens . 
temperatures 15 c. protected animals lung well kidney 
disease . higher temperatures disturbed host-parasite relationships 
led higher incidence malignancy . bullfrog, precancer 
clearly associated worm attachment discs . 
  (3) histological types tumors vermont frogs included 
lymphosarcomas, liposarcoma, mesothelioma, epithelioma, adrenal 
cartilage tumors uncertain malignancy . 
  (4) improved methods obtaining tumor filtrates allowed greater 
probability inducing malignancy direct renal injection . 106 
frogs 37 per cent developed histologically provable cancers 
ranges three seven months . twenty-six per cent showed 
pre-cancer response 43 per cent negative . within series 
receiving filtrate high malignancy donors one group yielded 100 per 
cent positive, others 50 38 per cent, respectively . 
  (5) among animals injected /low/ malignancy filtrate, fewer 
tumors resulted . clearly vesicular carcinomas 
classed lung tumors . 
  (6) improved tissue culture methods allowed explants live liquid 
media perforated cellophane one year . slower growth, aided 
lower temperatures (16 c.) improved microecology cell types 
allowed detailed daily observations cell's intranuclear 
intranucleolar physiology extended time-lapse cine-photography . 
  (7) mechanisms malignant transformation related increased 
activity production nucleolar dna rna . infective dna 
hypothesis classical virus theory, offer detailed 
support .
