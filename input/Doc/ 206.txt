rapidly migrating anodal bands increased activity 
cathodal bands slower migrating anodal bands . heart reverse 
changes observed . high enough ldh activities early fetal 
tissue extracts applied gel full complement ldh 
isozymes observed,. however, lower concentrations cathodal 
bands, starch gel disappear rapidly dilution
