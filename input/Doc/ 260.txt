ventricular septal defect aortic insufficiency clinical 
hemodynamic study 18 proved cases . 
  eighteen patients combination ventricular septal defect 
aortic insufficiency studied . nine also infundibular 
pulmonary stenosis . seventeen treated open-heart operations . 
  physical findings typical ventricular defect 
murmur thrill together aortic insufficiency blow wide 
pulse pressure . systolic murmur upper left sternal border 
thrill strongly suggestive additional lesion infundibular 
pulmonary stenosis, presence absence infundibular 
pulmonary stenosis indicated accurately cardiac 
catheterization inspection operation . 
sufficient severity signs additional right ventricular 
hypertrophy appear electrocardiogram . 
  retrograde aortography serves demonstrate severity 
aortic regurgitation . 
  problem surgical correction lesions will 
subject separate communication .
