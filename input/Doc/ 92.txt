demonstration ventricular aneurysms radioisotope scanning . 
  radioisotope scanning cardiac blood pool intravenous 
injection -labeled iodipamide carried 14 patients 
ventricular aneurysm . 4, aneurysm demonstrated 
neither anteroposterior chest roentgenogram scan . 5, 
aneurysm apparent radiograph, blood pool 
enter area, suggesting thrombus within aneurysm . 5, 
aneurysm detectable film also seen filled 
radioactivity scan . presumably findings showed 
thrombus yet formed . blood pool radioisotope scanning appears 
another tool diagnosis ventricular aneurysm, useful also 
demonstrating patients presence absence 
intraluminal clot within aneurysm .
