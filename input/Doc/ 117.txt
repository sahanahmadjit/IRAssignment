current techniques surgical approach aortic mitral 
valvular disease . 
  1. aortic mitral valves can operated upon successfully 
totally replaced prosthetic device ball-valve type 
good long-term results . seventy-four cases reported . 
  2. aortic valvular disease outcome immediate 
postoperative period influenced primarily presence calcific 
aortic stenosis well presence absence disease 
coronary arteries . 
  3. significantly decreased appearance low-output 
syndrome postoperatively patients suffering severe 
mitral disease leaving papillary muscle-chordae tendineae-mural 
leaflet relationship intact . feel adds strength 
contraction . 
  4. late deaths follow-up period date 
(thirty months) patient replacement aortic mitral 
valves ball-valve prosthesis .
