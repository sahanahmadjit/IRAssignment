  over-all operative mortality 4 . 
  post-operative evaluation showed results good 
almost patients, including pulmonary hypertension . 
  since ostium primum defect requires cardio-pulmonary bypass 
closure, pre-operative recognition defect highly desirable

therefore, unexpected discovery primum defect operation

repair atrial septal defect secundum type 
associated anomalies safe practical technique effectively 
corrects anomaly minimal risk .
