experiments dealing role played aqueous humor retina 
lens regeneration adult newts . 
  1. three groups experiments involve approximately 140 eyes 
adult newts, triturus v. viridescens . devised examine 
what, any, role aqueous humor plays lens regeneration 
dorsal iris . 
  2. many daily injections aqueous humor normal eyes made 
lentectomized eyes long 96 days cases . controls 
lensless eyes daily injected holtfreter's solution . 
others aqueous humor merely withdrawn . 
  3) procedures injection experiments difficult control . 
however, successful cases showed varying degrees inhibition 
retardation lens regeneration . 
  4. pairs eyes united large adjacent wound openings 
provide common reservoir aqueous humor bathing lenses 
dorsal irises . cases eyes placed side 
body . others successful unions made fusing 
transplanted eye right eye host . 
  5. approximately three months operation one two large lens 
regenerates pair perfectly fused eyes removed . six weeks 
later new large lens regenerate reappeared 
lentectomized units presence intact lens unit 
  6. strong possibility normal amount 
neural retina present provided powerful retinal factor lens 
regeneration inhibiting influence intact lens 
environment .
