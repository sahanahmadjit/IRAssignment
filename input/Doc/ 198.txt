carrier state bacillus subtilis infected transducing 
bacteriophage sp10 . 
  bacteriophage sp10 may infect bacillus subtilis form carrier 
system . infected bacteria give rise infected organisms six 
successive single-colony isolations . 60 spores 
derived infected culture yield clones produce phage, 
spores retain ability produce phage even 
treatment antiserum heating 80 . four hours' incubation 
carrier spores nutrient broth yields cultures 10 
infective centers per bacterium . cultivation infected organisms 
medium containing sp10 antiserum leads loss phage loss 
immunity phage infection . dna density characteristic viral 
dna can detected infected bacteria . extracts infected bacteria 
contain phage-induced deoxyribonuclease activity attacks 
phage bacterial dna vitro . phage-bacterial complex 
therefore best described carrier state . 
  dna phage b. subtilis chemically different . 
enzymatically prepared complementary virus rna homology 
bacterial dna . lack homology transducing phage dna 
dna host failure form truly lysogenic 
relationship reinforce previous conclusions transducing bacterial 
dna incorporated sp10 virus particle without 
recombination viral bacterial dna .
