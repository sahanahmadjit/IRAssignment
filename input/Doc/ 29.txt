  gel diffusion precipitin technique commercially prepared 
antisera, urine/plasma ratios specific proteins determined . 
individual protein clearances, expressed percentage transferrin 
clearance, plotted ordinates respective molecular 
weights log-log graph . straight line evident graphically, 
constants estimated method least squares, 
slope, expressed , determined . slope line may said 
express degree glomerular selectivity protein excretion . 
sixty-five determinations performed 48 patients . 45 satisfying 
usual criteria nephrotic syndrome . 
  1) patients primary renal disease nephrotic 
syndrome displayed high selectivity types proteinuria ( greater 
average group + 1 sd) usually respond initially 
steroid therapy, regardless acute subacute glomerular changes 
observed renal biopsy . 
  2) patients chronic renal disease nephrotic 
syndrome display average frequently low selectivity type 
proteinuria . 
  3) appears characteristic type selectivity 
given pathologic group patients nephrotic syndrome . 
  4) degree selective protein excretion related 
total daily amount protein excreted one time remains 
fairly constant despite fluctuation amount protein 
excreted . 
  5) slight correlation borderline significance 
degree selective protein excretion duration 
disease, initial para-aminohippuric acid clearance . 
  6) statistically significant correlation exists initial 
blood urea nitrogen inulin clearance selectivity type 
protein excretion . patients azotemic 
initially near-normal inulin clearances average selectivity type 
better . 
  7) suggested adult patient initially azotemic 
grossly abnormal inulin clearance, response therapy 
unlikely, whereas blood urea nitrogen normal inulin 
clearance near normal, response therapy predicted 
degree accuracy . studies adult patients 
nephrotic syndrome required substantiate premise .
