early effects digitalis central hemodynamics normal subjects . 
  intravenous administration lanatoside c 7 normal subjects 
following effects.. 
  1. early significant reduction heart rate . 
  2. significant transient reduction cardiac output . 
  3. significant increase stroke volume initially accompanied 
significant rise end-diastolic volume unchanged 
systolic rate emptying . increase end-diastolic volume seems 
related lengthening diastolic filling period . later 
on, systolic emptying rate increases, ventricular volumes 
decrease, suggesting inotropic effect drug . 
  4. significant increase pulmonary blood volume, parallel 
increase stroke volume, suggestive passive relation 
two variables .
