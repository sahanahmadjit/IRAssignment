basically consist system membranous profiles limiting 
membrane unit type . 
  inclusion bodies appear result focal cytoplasmic degradation 
occurs rapidly changing cuboidal alveolar epithelium . 
inclusion bodies developing rat lung similar so-called 
/lamellar transformed mitochondria./ however, evidence presented 
suggesting alteration cytoplasmic membranes may involved 
process inclusion body formation . certain images associated
