twelve patients described neuro-ophthalmic symptoms resulting 
bilateral cerebral lesions areas occipital lobes.  
symptoms signs categorized follows  group  showing 
predominant disturbances visual object recognition (visual agnosia) 
disturbances visual spatial localization.  group iia  defects 
voluntary control eye movements (ocular motor apraxia).  group iib  
persistent palsies conjugate gaze.  although symptoms may 
present extent unilateral lesions, much profound 
less able compensated bilateral lesions.  evidence 
present cases suggests biparieto-temporal localization lesions 
causing visual agnosia, disturbances spatial localization, ocular motor 
apraxia, frontal localization lesions causing prolonged 
paralysis conjugate gaze.
