heretofore unreported association defects, namely hypoglycemia, growth 
retardation, deficiency serum growth hormonelike activity 
1-year-old child described.  human growth hormone (hgh), 3 mg. day 7 
days, doubled fasting blood sugar, prevented postprandial hypoglycemia, 
reversed sensitivity tolbutamide leucine.  treatment 1 mg. 
hgh 3 times week produced growth 7 inches 3 months compared
