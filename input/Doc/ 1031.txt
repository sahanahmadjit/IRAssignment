epsilon-aminocaproic acid (e-aca) therapeutic agent based 5 
years clinical experience. 
   experience treatment 744 patients 
e-aca suggested use preparation indicated 
following situations: (1) fibrinolytic haemorrhage 
association delivery.  (2) acute systemic 
fibrinolysis association surgery.  
mainly major operations thorax, pancreas, prostate, 
liver genital organs complicated 
fibrinolysis, fibrinolytic bleedings can occur 
operation.  (3) acute systemic fibrinolysis patients 
cancer, particularly cancer prostate 
pancreas.  (4) systemic fibrinolytic states complicating 
various disorders, especially leukaemia, liver 
cirrhosis boeck's sarcoid.  (5) antidote 
thrombolytic therapy.  (6) local fibrinolytic activity 
urinary tract following situations: (a) 
prostatectomy.  e-aca will substantially reduce 
blood losses following prostatectomy, especially 
treatment continued urine become macroscopically 
clear.  (b) haematuria prostatic cancer, 
prostatic hyperplasia, prolonged haematuria traumatic 
injury kidney, haematuria haemophilia 
coagulation defects, so-called essential haematuria. 
(7) ulcerative colitis.  drug equally effective

proved sufficient.  side-effects consisted dizziness, 
nausea diarrhoea.  toxic effects drug 
e.c.g., blood picture, n.p.n. liver function tests 
observed, even cases receiving 
1000 g e-aca.  postmortem examination 
46 cases reveal signs toxic effect.  signs
