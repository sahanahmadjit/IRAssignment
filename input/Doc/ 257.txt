apparent immunofluorescence tissue mast cells . 
  rat mast cells rat cosinophils exhibited fluorescence blue 
violet light treatment fitc-conjugated rabbit anti-rat 
g-globulin cell fluorescence immunologically 
nonspecific . 
  whereas cosinophils fluoresced treatment fluorescein alone, 
mast cells fluoresced treatment protein conjugate 
containing g-globulin . 
  phenomenon observed cells different organs 
fluorescence seen associated cytoplasmic granules 
normally present cells .
