  first paper, particulary concerned 
technical aspects, important collect data . 
  position collimator precordium, injection 
isotopes catheter, just behind ventricle near 
tricuspid valve, selection ratemeter constants velocity 
paper recorder way read area curve, 
specially discussed . 
  finally, present formula used calculate cardiac output, 
ventricular volumes pulmonary blood volumes .
