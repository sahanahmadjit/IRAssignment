light electron microscope study developing respiratory tissue 
rat . 
  1. light microscopic observations development rat lung 
shown presence glandular, canalicular alveolar stages . 
  2. three stages can identified electron microscopy 
may present different parts lung one time, e.g. 
40 45 mm. c.r. length . 
  3. glandular stage, lung tissue immature 
appearance light microscopy electron microscopy individual 
cells also immature respect organelles . glycogen present 
immature cells . 
  4. canalicular stage, lung tissue becomes vascular . 
  5. throughout stages development, 'duct' 'air' spaces 
always lined continuous complete epithelium, blood 
vessels complete endothelium . 
  6. lamellated inclusion bodies present epithelial (endodermal) 
cells early stage development . 
  7. micropinocytotic vesicles present large numbers 
epithelial endothelial cytoplasm suggested 
foetus may indicate absorption amniotic fluid alveolar 
spaces . 
  8. mechanism alveolar distension discussed nature 
remains uncertain . 
  9. respiratory tissue rat fully differentiated birth 
importance fact human infants discussed . 
  10. adult blood-air barrier, consisting epithelium, zona 
diffusa endothelium, varies thickness .
