autolysis bacillus subtilis glucose depletion . 
  cultures minimal medium, rapid lysis cells bacillus 
subtilis observed soon carbon source, e.g. glucose, 
completely consumed . cells died ultraviolet-absorbing 
material excreted medium . results suggest cells 
lyse presence autolytic enzymes . presence 
glucose damage cell wall caused enzymes repaired 
immediately .
