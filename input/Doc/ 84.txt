heparin levels hypothermic perfusion . 
  1. perfusion-temperature influences rate heparin-loss 
extracorporeal circulation, therefore, requirement 
re-heparinization . 
  2. heparin half-lives approximately 13/4 hours 21/2 hours 
calculated perfusions conducted average temperatures 31.5 
22.6 c. respectively . 
  3. rate heparin-loss extracorporeal circulation 
inconstant individual, variable individuals, 
exact neutralization requires accurate estimation heparin 
concentration present end perfusion . 
  4. protamine titration test provides crude simple 
satisfactory means monitoring free-heparin levels . 
  5. complete neutralization heparin important factor 
minimizing postoperative blood losses . 
  6. protamine less efficient neutralizing agent polybrene 
dosage level . may effective divided dosage . 
  7. /rebound/ detected 5 45 cases studied, although 
one instance degree likely significant . 
  8. significant prolongation clotting-time resulting excess 
neutralizing agent, evident study .
