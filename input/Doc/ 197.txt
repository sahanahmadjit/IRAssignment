  (i) comparative examinations shown temperate subtilis 
phages can divided two groups . b. subtilis strain nrs 231 
adequate common host sensitive examined temperate phages . 
  owing certain technical advantages strain found suitable 
titration subtilis phages . 
  (ii) cultural differences revealed among substrains 
b. subtilis 168 ind auxotrophs maintained various laboratories . 
cells one cultures partly capable partly incapable 
using ammonia . ammonia assimilation transducible ammonia 
negative bacteria . 
  (iii) mitomycin c ultraviolet ray induction examined b. 
subtilis strains liberated /bacteriocin/-like principles . finding 
probably analogous seaman et al. concerning pbsx defective 
phages . basis bacteriocin production examined strains 
divided two groups . 
  (iv) several temperate phages isolated laboratory 
presumably identical phage pbs 1 . phage sp 10 differed 
agents antigenic structure host range . 
  (v) transduction lysates pbs 1-type phages observed 
frequencies order 10 . considerably less effective 
phage materials yielded lysogenic transductants . thus 
transducing phages active order 10 prepared . 
  (vi) transduction frequency, addition properties 
phage, influenced physiological condition bacteria . 
  (vii) transduction indole histidine loci studied use 
derivatives strain 168 ind .
