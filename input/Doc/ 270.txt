mesenteric vascular response hypothermia . 
  1. total segmental resistances studied mesenteries 
37 dogs, effects hypothermia, changes blood viscosity 
epinephrine resistances compared . 
  2. cooling 15 c. caused increased mesenteric resistance 94 
per cent animals approximately 90 per cent resistance 
rise contributed arterial segment . small vessel resistance 
increased 52 per cent . evidence venous constriction 
  3. blood viscosity appeared play minor role . 
  4. suggested hemorrhagic necrosis bowel wall due 
intense vasoconstriction precapillary vessels subsequent 
distal anoxia cellular damage .
