current status hypothermia . 
  moderate hypothermia recommended many varied 
conditions . today value questioned light 
controlled groups patients . moment use justified 
certain cardiac operations circulation may 
interrupted short periods.. general surgical procedures 
massive, sudden blood loss may anticipated.. neurosurgical 
operations /relaxed/ brain required.. following acute hypoxia 
seen cardiac arrest.. perhaps therapy acute 
septicemic shock . 
  profound hypothermia association extracorporeal circulation 
rests shakier premises, can value major cardiac 
operations asystole required certain neurosurgical 
procedures complete interruption circulation indicated . 
  great hazard development inadvertent 
unrecognized hypothermia anesthetized patient . monitoring 
body temperature important feature care patient
