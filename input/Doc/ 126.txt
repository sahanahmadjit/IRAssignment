hypothermia/ circulatory arrest . 
  1. perfusion hypothermia produces large temperature gradients within 
body since organs cooled roughly proportion basal 
blood flows . difference coldest warmest portion 
body 30 minutes perfusion exceeds 25 c . 
  2. average body temperature, provides proper measure 
total body cooling, may calculated arteriovenous temperature 
difference extracorporeal flow rate . 
  3. true /deep/ hypothermia obtainable reasonable periods 
perfusion alone . 
  4. important rise core temperatures occurs circulatory 
arrest hypothermia relatively high average body 
temperature . 
  5. high average body temperatures lead continuing production 
lactic acid muscle tissue, whereas low core temperatures impair 
lactic acid metabolism . thus metabolic acidosis progressive 
prolonged perfusion hypothermia, accentuated total circulatory 
arrest . progressive acidosis may minimized uniform profound 
cooling combining external perfusion hypothermia . 
  6 diluents appear little effect total body heat exchange 
perfusion cooling . 
  7. perfusion warming differentially greater effect core 
organs . though readily brought normal range, much 
animal may remain cold .
