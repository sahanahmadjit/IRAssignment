  fine structure cultured mucoid adenocarcinoma cell human 
lung (mac-21) described compared fine structure 
hela cell . differences fine structure two strains 
primarily quantitative . mac-21 cell differed, however, 
following respects.. spindle-shaped cell larger nucleus 
increased nuclear membrane invaginations, considerably larger 
amounts perinuclear golgi apparatus . cytoplasm contained areas 
low density, undefined limiting membrane, thought 
accumulations mucin . 
  two cell strains contained numerous multivesicular bodies, 
lamellae various stages development, suggesting 
organelles may involved formation lipide-rich, 
myelinated structures observed hela mac-21 cells . 
number myelinated bodies found inversely proportional
