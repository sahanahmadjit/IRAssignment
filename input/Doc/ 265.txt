  origin fate small lymphoid cells dog bone marrow 
studied autoradiographically observing effect clamping 
femoral artery vivo availability h3-thymidine . heavily 
labeled small lymphoid cells appeared bone marrow clamped 
leg 3 hours injection tracer increased number 
6 days . labeling indices cells, however, 
significantly lower control marrow . possible 
interpretation dog bone marrow contains two populations small 
lympho id cells, one migrating marrow via blood stream, 
originating local precursor cells within marrow . 
evidence transformation migrated small lymphoid cells
