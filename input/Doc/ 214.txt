neurological manifestations . 
  neurologic manifestations frequent patients sickle 
cell disease . manifestations may earliest presenting signs 
symptoms variable patient may 
erroneously diagnosed conditions meningitis, 
poliomyelitis, subdural hematoma, neoplasm, subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
lead encephalitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, congenital 
malformations brain . furthermore, development 
manifestations predicted basis type crisis 
involved . 
  prognosis following neurological involvement unpredictable, 
recurrent episodes, together abnormal electroencephalographic 
readings suggest poor outcome . patients die victims 
rather severe neurological deficits . 
  neurological examination patients suggests diffuse 
involvement cerebral hemispheres . examination 
pathological material, however, often fails reveal thromboses . 
striking findings infarcts white matter perivascular 
hemorrhages .
