cameroons rain-forest exist two strains loa, apparently 
evolving host-vector complex (duke wijers, 1958).  natural 
simian parasite found abundantly drill (mandrillus 
leucophaeus), characterized large somatic size adult worms 
microfilariae nocturnal microfilariae periodicity.  
transmitted among monkey population crepuscular canopy-dwelling 
chrysops langi c. centurionis.  natural human parasite diurnally 
periodic microfilariae transmitted day-biting anthropophilic 
c. silacea c. dimidiata (bombe form).  can also transmitted 
experimentally drill, host parasites small somatic 
size maintain diurnal periodicity. 
two strains contrasting periodicity can maintained drills, 
decided try cross-mating produce hybrids.  present paper 
describes methods done, records characteristics 
hybrid parasites, suggests that, interbreeding, two strains 
segregate according simple mendelian pattern regards periodicity 
somatic size.
