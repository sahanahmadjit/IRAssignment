  observe detail influence streptomycin growth sm 
dependent type, author chose b. subtilis (atcc 558) made 
experiments responses streptomycin, special reference 
relation sm concentration spore formation sm 
dependent type together germination outgrowth spores 
formed . results follows . 
  1. among 18x10 cells wild type b. subtilis (atcc 558) 
3,200 cells sm resistant one cell sm dependent found 
mutant . 
  2. b. substilis (atcc 558) shows normal growth sm concentration 
10 r/ml, growth declines rapidly sm 10 r/ml-20 r/m 
l, growth stops entirely sm concentration 20 r/ml . 
  3. sm resistant type grows well sm 0.1 r/ml-sm 2,000 r/ml, 
growth declines rapidly sm 10,000 r/ml . 
  4. sm dependent type shows normal growth sm 10,000 r/ml-20 r/m 
l, growth get worth sm 10 r/ml, cell shape elongates 
several times, sm 1 r/ml cell becomes filamentous form 
several ten times length normal cell, cells 
stopped divide low sm concentration . 
  6. germination outgrowth spores sm dependent type 
slow decline sm concentration, germinated spores 
grow normal forms sm concentration reaches 7.8 r/ml, 
germination becomes much slower, cells grow filamentous forms 
irregular forms . extremely low sm concentration germination 
outgrowth nearly stop .
