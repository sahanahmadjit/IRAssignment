  previous communication reported increased vivo incorporation 
p-32 albuminoid rna fraction rat lens 6 hours 
animal exposed x-radiation (1,500 r) . 
  present stody, vitro uptake p-32 c-14-adenine 
albuminoid, ribosomal, soluble rna fractions normal 
x-irradiated rat lenses measured . rna fractions extracted 
sodium dodecyl sulfate 0.9 per cent nacl . specific rna 
fractions also hydrolyzed, chromatographed (on paper), ac- 
tivity individual nucleotides (as well specific rna frac- 
tions) determined . experiment also performed 
capsules removed (after 3 hour incubation period) 
activities determined nucleic acids extracted capsules 
three rna fractions remaining lens matter . 
  results experiments indicate incorporation 
p-32 c-14-adenine albuminoid rna markedly stimulated 1 hour 
1,500 r whole body radiation . significant effect

  effect formaldehyde heating x-irradiated albuminoid rna 
much less albuminoid rna derived control animals .
