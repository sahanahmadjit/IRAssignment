carcinogenic activities s.c. administered 
n-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene 
(n-hydroxy-aaf) variety metal chelates indicate greater 
activity locally associated longer retention chelates 
site injection slow release n-hydroxy-aaf surrounding 
tissue.  tumors obtained sites 4 injections n-hydroxy-aaf 
(3.2 mg. /injection), 4 16 20 rats developed sarcomas 
sites 8 16 injections, respectively.  nickelous, cobaltous, ferric, 
cupric chelates induced moderate high incidences sarcomas 1 4 
injections; cases one-half administered n-hydroxy-aaf 
retained injection site 4-50 days.  manganous zinc chelates 
potassium salt less active injection site; 
half-retention times ranged 2.5 hr. 2.5 days.  comparable 
half-retention time n-hydroxy-aaf 2 hr.  injection metal 
derivatives s. c. short half-retention times resulted higher incidences 
mammary tumors injection derivatives half-retention 
times 4 days.  administered food cupric chelate 
n-hydroxy-aaf induced spectrum tumors n-hydroxy-aaf, 
incidences lower.  prolonged retention material 
injection site may account greater carcinogenic activities 
metal chelates, serious consideration must also given possible 
importance chelation carcinogens metabolites cellular
