conditions . 
  method described allows determination /attenuation 
curves/ human eye . curves obtained plotting 
critical depth modulation (cmd) function critical fusion 
frequency (cff) . routine experiments carried 2 test 
field showing sinusoidal periodical variation luminance, 
surrounded extensive area luminance equal average 
luminance test field . attenuation curves obtained 
normal observers different experimental conditions 
number patients . shown method affords us information 
obtained means classical methods measuring 
cff .
