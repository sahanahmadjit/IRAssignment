electron microscopic studies mycoplasma (pplo strain 880) 
artificial medium tissue culture. 
mycoplasma strain 880, isolated leukemic 
patient, studied broth 
cultures several cell culture lines. 
strain exhibited considerable pleomorphism 
size, internal structure, 
shape, including forms filamentous 
projections.  common form observed 
0.5 1 diameter 
nuclear area fibrillar strands, probably 
dna.  cytoplasm organisms 
contained ribosome-like granules 
flattened vacuole indented 
nuclear area.  various forms, 
including 'elementary bodies' 100m 
diameter electron-dense. 
tissue culture lines 
cells grew monolayer, mycoplasma 
closely associated 
cell surface occasionally seen 
membrane-lined cytoplasmic vacuoles. 
cell lines attach glass, 
mycoplasma fewer

consistent suggestion 
mycoplasma may several mechanisms 
reproduction (growth).  intracellular 
mycoplasma may protected 
antibiotics.  partly explain 
difficulty eradicating mycoplasma 
infected cell cultures.
