rule tubular secretion phosphate locate site action 
parathyroid hormone (p.t.h.) renal tubule.  experimental 
conditions used, significant inward transtubular movement p32 
demonstrated, ruling tubular secretion phosphate.  stop-flow 
experiments performed parathyroidectomized dogs p.t.h. 
administration demonstrated inhibition phosphorus reabsorption 
hormone.  addition, stop-flow pattern indicated 
phenomenon took place mainly distal part proximal tubules.
