toxicity sulfur-35, selenium, tellurium avian embryos . 
  continuous internal irradiation chick embryos sulfur-35 
administered 4th 8th day incubation produced abnormalities 
similar observed selenium toxicosis avian embryos . 
highest level sulfur-35 (1600 uc) injected eggs containing 4-day 
embryos produced morphological abnormalities severe 
produced level radiosulfur administered 8-day embryos, 
level stable selenium tolerated . selenium levels 
greater 30 ug killed embryos within 24 hours 
injection . nearly 20 times tellurium selenium required 
kill embryos within 24 hours.. abnormalities observed 
tellurium-injected embryos .
