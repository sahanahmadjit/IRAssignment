serum tissues . (1) elevation total serum lipid, 
phospholipid, triglyceride, free fatty acid cholesterol,. (2) 
total lipid liver kidney increased, depot 
fat decreased,. (3) palmitate oleate increased serum 
liver,. (4) arachidonate stearate decreased serum liver,. 
(5) placentas contain stearate organs
