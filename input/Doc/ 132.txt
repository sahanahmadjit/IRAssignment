  added transition metal ions stabilize secondary structure 
tobacco mosaic virus ribonucleic acid (tmv-rna) evidenced 
reduction absorbancy change heated nucleic acid solutions . 
spite stabilization secondary structure, heating 
presence metal ions results loss biological activity due 
hydrolysis phosphodiester bonds . thus, heavy metal ions 
iib first-transition elements studied caused rapid loss 
biological activity tmv-rna ph 6.5 65 . calcium magnesium 
ions, affecting secondary structure 65 ph 8.5, caused 
rapid loss biological activity . ph 5.8 room temperature lead 
ions catalyzed hydrolysis rna i'(3')- mononucleotides,. 
long standing, nucleosides formed .
