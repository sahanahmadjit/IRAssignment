function represented tendency young seek 
proximity certain members species 
suitable operational definition may found behavior 
individual deprived proximity . 
  study takes form longitudinal follow-up, 60 
infants investigated four-weekly intervals early weeks 
end first year 18 months age . 
use attachment scale, based seven everyday separation 
situations, following three main parameters explored.. age 
onset specific attachments, intensity attachments, 
number objects attachments formed . measure 
fear-of-strangers also included . 
  results indicate age onset specific attachments 
generally found third quarter first year, 
preceded phase indiscriminate attachment behavior,. 
intensity specific attachment increases first month 
following onset thereafter fluctuations occur individual 
cases make long-term prediction difficult,. multiplicity 
objects can found instances beginning 
specific attachment phase, becoming rule remaining 
cases soon thereafter . correlations attachment 
variables, well fear-of-strangers measure, presented, 
examination also made conditions eliciting protest 
proximity loss, manner protest expressed, 
conditions necessary terminate protest . 
  individual differences regard three main parameters 
explored subgroup 36 infants . number variables 
examined relation individual differences, suggestions 
made regarding conditions affect manifestation
