long-term study mechanism action immunosuppressive drugs 
completed bilaterally nephrectomized dogs kidney homotransplants. 
1,000 test animals 24 different drug protocols analyzed. 
increasing numbers long surviving animals posed many questions 
regarding status treated host.  current drug protocol azathioprine 
diazoacetylserine ('azaserine') produced 90% 50-day survivors 50% 
100-day survivors.  following observations documented  
animals prolonged drug therapy immunologically competent; drug therapy 
can stopped successfully animals; long surviving kidneys 
apparently protected way new environment 
second donor kidney can rejected first survives; retransplantation 
long surviving kidney back original host lead decrease 
renal function; long surviving kidneys successfully retransplanted back 
original donors rejected transplanted third party, 
non-drug treated recipients; immune paralysis account 
prolonged survival second donor kidney constitutes double 
dose antigen rejected first continues survive; absorption 
metabolism drug account variation results 
two kidneys, separate donors, can rejected differentially 
drug treated host; hosts sensitized recipient 
sensitization continues even animals successfully weaned 
drugs.  additional analyses relationship skin homografts kidney 
homografts reveal following  skin homografts universally rejected 
within 20 days hosts treated drug regimen protects kidney 
homografts sometimes permanently.  skin kidney homografts 
donor placed simultaneously skin survival prolonged kidney 
survival shortened.  paradoxical effect probably explained 
production antibodies skin absorbed rejecting kidney. 
additional observations indicate drug-treated animals, male female, 
fertile multiple rejection processes can produce generalized 
immunological picture host similar autoimmune disease process.
