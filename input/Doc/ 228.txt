  urinary neutral 17-ketosteroid fractions pregnanediol excreted 
21 patients prostatic cancer, 17 patients benign hypertrophy, 
59 clinically well subjects assayed determine whether 
differences exist . 
  patients prostatic cancer benign hypertrophy 
excreted significantly less androsterone clinically well 
subjects . disproportionately lower level androsterone 
etiocholanolone resulted significantly lower 
androsterone/etiocholanolone ratio groups . 
  specificity findings discussed . lower levels 
androsterone excreted patients benign hypertrophy 
associated extended period hospitalization . patients 
hospitalized less 5 days excreted androsterone levels 
significantly different clinically well subjects . 
  lower levels androsterone excreted patients prostatic 
cancer explained presence metastasis, duration 
hospitalization, loss appetite, definable differences, 
considered singly . possible interrelationships clinical 
differences prevent assigning lower excretion levels cancer state 
alone .
