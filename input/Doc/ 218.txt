  465 consecutive patients subjected standardized battery 
neuropsychological tests, 111 one components gerstmann's 
syndrome . 111 patients evidence organic brain 
dysfunction addition gerstmann components . number 
gerstmann components increased, responsible brain lesions tended 
larger, highly destructive tissue, cause greater 
neurological impairment . every patient four gerstmann components 
associated evidence severe impairment brain functions 
lesion underlying disease likely compromise survival

merges numerous neurological deficits, notably dysphasia 
agreement benton, find justification singling 
four gerstmann components separate syndrome, unless one also 
prepared recognize arbitrary groups concurrent 
deficits also separate syndromes . 
  least three 23 patients four gerstmann components,

lesion increased number gerstmann components, 
probability involvement left posterior parasylvian area also 
increased increase number gerstmann components .
