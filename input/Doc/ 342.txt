combined series studies, 6 409 rats (n.b. 195 survived 
3 wk.) exposed nickel carbonyl developed pulmonary carcinoma 
metastases.  lesions included common types pulmonary cancer, 
squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma anaplastic carcinoma.  
pulmonary lesions found 24 27 mth. initial

lung cancer rat comparable amount nickel inhaled 
persons smoking less 15 cigarettes per day period year.  
mean weight rats chronically exposed nickel carbonyl found 
consistently less control rats throughout entire 3-year
