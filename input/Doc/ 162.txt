goat . 
  effects nitrogen insufflation cannulated rumen 
studied 10 goats . parameters measured included cerebral 
blood flow, mean carotid arterial pressure, pressure confluence 
sinuses, cerebrospinal fluid pressure, blood oxygen carbon 
dioxide contents, packed cell volume (pcv), hemoglobin concentration 
values cerebrovascular resistance cerebral o utilization 
calculated . 
  increased ruminal pressure little effect cerebral blood flow 
cerebrovascular resistance . cerebral o utilization decreased 
intraruminal pressure increased . decrease caused 
reduction arterial o content consequent decrease 
cerebral arteriovenous o difference . mean arterial, venous sinus, 
cerebrospinal fluid pressures increased intraruminal 
pressure increased . increases pcv hemoglobin concentration 
related elevated intraruminal pressure . 
  central nervous system signs goats acute ruminal tympany may 
caused cerebral hypoxia . nature hypertensive changes 
associated increased ruminal pressure demonstrated, due 
influence multiple factors fluid compartments, conclusions 
made mechanism pressure responses . 
mechanical factors, however, may involved .
