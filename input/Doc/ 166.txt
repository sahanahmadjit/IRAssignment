  lens cell dna, rna, protein synthesis developing mouse eye 
studied use tritium-labeled thymidine, uridine, l- 
leucine autoradiographic techniques . mouse embryonic lens, 
epithelial cells undergoing dna synthesis found entire 
anterior lens surface . birth eyes opened 
percentage epithelial cells undergoing dna synthesis rapidly 
decreased . later percentage epithelial cells undergoing dna 
synthesis nearly constant germinative zone became localized 
lens equator region . rna synthesis occurred nucleated 
cells developing lens embryonic stage eyelids 
opened . lens maturity h uridine incorporated rna 
superficial cells . similar pattern tritium 
incorporation seen h l-leucine .
