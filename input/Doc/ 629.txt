cineradiographic comparison normal noncleft subjects velopharyngeal 
inadequacy 
cineradiographic studies normal subjects compared 
studies noncleft subjects demonstrated velopharyngeal inadequacy. 
following conclusions made: a) significant difference 
soft palate length normals velopharyngeal inadequacy 
group.  b) significant difference depth nasopharynx 
normal velopharyngeal inadequacy group.  c) 
difference means soft palate length depth nasopharynx 
normals velopharyngeal inadequacy group significant. 
d) thickness soft palate greater normal 
abnormal group.  e) 70% normal velopharyngeal inadequacy 
groups height soft palate elevation palatal plane.   f) 
80% normal group height velopharyngeal closure took 
place palatal plane.  none subjects velopharyngeal 
inadequacy group obtained velopharyngeal closure.  g) significant 
correlation amount gap voice quality.  h) 
significant correlation amount gap intelligibility 
speech.  i) difference vital capacity readings 
velopharyngeal inadequacy group nose occluded unoccluded.  j) 
correlation coefficient quality judgment intelligibility 
judgment highly significant.
