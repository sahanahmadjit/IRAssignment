  rate expression ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) 
ligand exchange reaction nickel(cysteine) is.. rate = k(complex) + 
kedta (complex)(edta) . two-term rate expression characteristic 
square planar complexes agrees square planar 
configuration ni(cysteine) reported basis spectral studies 
edta-independent term rate expression acid-catalyzed 
term can written k (h) (complex) . value kn 2.5 x 10 m 
sec value kedta order 10 -10 m sec . 
edta reaction ni(cysteine) methyl ester) similar 
reaction ni(cysteine) . sulfur-containing amino acid 
ligand contains thiol ether, kinetic differences striking . 
  ligand exchange reactions edta, triethylenetetramine, 
diethylenetriamine nickel-methionine complexes several orders 
magnitude faster give products mixed-ligand complexes .

sulfhydryl thiol ether sulfur groups support studies 
equilibrium suggest sulfur coordination square planar 
complexes sulfhydryl groups octahedral complexes 
sulfur coordination thiol ethers .
