oxygen consumption paralysed men exposed cold . 
  1. oxygen consumption carbon dioxide output measured 
human subjects cooled 80-210 min . two subjects normal, 
one almost completely paralysed neck 
poliomyelitis, two unconscious result intracranial 
damage observed without paralysing doses muscle 
relaxants (d-tubocurarine gallamine) . 
  2. normal subjects unconscious subjects receiving drugs 
cooled, oxygen consumption carbon dioxide output rose . 
  3. subjects paralysed disease drugs cooled, oxygen 
consumption carbon dioxide output increased . 
  4. observations consistent view man 
increase metabolism cooling periods 31/2 hr occurs 
solely skeletal muscle .
