numerous reports published concerning 
necessity testing presence mycoplasmas 
interpretation experiments performed cell 
cultures.  tests especially important 
presence viruses suspected, since recent evidence 
indicates mycoplasmas capable eliciting 
transmissible cytopathic effect. 
addition, mycoplasmas viruses share 
properties, size, filterability, morphology 
electron microscopy, sensitivity ether, ability 
haemagglutinate cause haemadsorption, interference 
virus replication vitro, lack inhibition certain 
commonly used antibiotics inhibition growth 
homologous antiserum.  thus, absence ordinary 
bacteria moulds preparations eliciting cytopathic 
effect cell cultures unreliable criterion viral 
identification.  great caution exercised 
classifying new agents viruses, especially myxo- 
viruses, without adequate testing exclude identity 
mycoplasmas.
