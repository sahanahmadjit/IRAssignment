iodine treatment conditions asphyxia . 
  blood sugar level glycogen concentration heart, brain 
liver rabbits treatment inorganic iodine, depot insulin, 
iodine insulin combined, hostacortine hostacortine iodine 
combined examined . control group remains untreated . 
second test series glycogen determination asphyxia (the 
trachea pinched three minutes) repeated . 
  contrary brain glycogen content heart muscle 
dependent upon blood sugar level . iodine treatment lowering 
blood sugar becomes noticeable, also increase heart 
glycogen . liver glycogen shows greater variations . levels 
achieved test series therefore show significant differences 
asphyxia significant lowering glycogen 
three organs . preliminary treatment iodine succeeds stopping 
lowering glycogen heart muscle brain .
