postural changes blood distribution relation change 
cardiac output . 
  (1) cardiac output blood content indices several parts 
body measured 18 subjects including patients various 
diseases using external radioisotope counting techniques . changes 
2 parameters induced standing compared . 
  (2) average changes blood distribution produced standing 
follows . decrease blood content /lung/ (-25 ) 
/heart/ (-26 ) increase /thigh/ (+56 ) statistically 
significant . significant change revealed /head/, /palm/, 
/liver/ /abdomen/ . 
  (3) cardiac output stroke volume decreased standing 
cases . recent data added reported previously 
treated statistically . average decrease cardiac output -13 6 
control cases, -35 16 cases neurocirculatory asthenia -35 
10 cases hyperthyroidism . difference significant 
control neurocirculatory asthenia . standing induced substantial 
increase cardiac output case idiopathic nodal rhythm, 
although remains doubt whether ordinary response 
disease . 
  (4) significant linear correlation revealed per cent 
change blood content /thigh/ /lung/ 
cardiac output stroke volume induced standing . minimal blood 
shift observed latter extreme, vice versa . 
implies follows.. reactivity heart might influenced 
posture, transmural pressure veins capillaries probably 
adjusted, arterioles, compensate changes cardiac output
