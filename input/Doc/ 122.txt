aneurysm membranous septum . 
  1. aneurysms membranous septum relatively rare lesions 
presumably developing congenital basis . aneurysms originate 
left ventricle immediately beneath aortic valve bulge 
right ventricle, septal leaflet tricuspid valve 
right atrium . 
  2. many aneurysms produce symptoms . others may cause 
right ventricular outflow tract obstruction may rupture result 
septal defect . resulting shunt will left ventricle 
right atrium ventricle . 
  3. aneurysm membranous septum may isolated abnormality 
associated congenital cardiac defects, particularly 
aortic valvular insufficiency . membranous septal aneurysms may 
site bacterial endocarditis thrombus formation . 
  4. aneurysms resembling arising membranous septum may 
occur part complex deformities produced endocardial 
cushion defect . however, angiographic features diagnostic 
cushion defect can still recognized . 
  5. presence septal aneurysm can established 
angiocardiography . diagnostic features seen left 
ventricular angiocardiogram presented .
