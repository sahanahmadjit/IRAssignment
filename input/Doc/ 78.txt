human tissue . 
  fine structure inclusions found within cytoplasm 
macrophages human lung, spleen, skin, lymph node, rectum 
described . 
  inclusions appear concentric whorled lamellae arranged 
around core . lamella constructed discrete, parallel 
filaments . inclusions resemble currently described viruses 
virus-like particles, resemble asbestos bodies 
known atmospheric pollutants ingestants . 
  resemblance lipid phase systems well mast cell 
granules,. possibly inclusions represent partial intracellular 
digestion phagocytized tissue membranes ingested mast cell 
granules, respectively . differences similarities exist 
inclusion bodies macrophages granules mast cells . 
variations due alterations mast cell granule morphology 
macrophage ingestion . 
  cytologic distinctions macrophages laden mast cell 
granules mast cells proper, remains obscure requires additional 
experimental evidence clear electron microscopic differentiation 
two cell types . 
  exact nature highly structured bodies remains speculative
