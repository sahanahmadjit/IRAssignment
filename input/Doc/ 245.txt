pulmonary vascular plexiform lesion pathogenetic studies . 
  attempt made test theory pulmonary arterial 
hypertension, plexiform lesion jet lesion beyond points 
arterial stenosis resulting nonspecific intimal thickening . 
  39 subjects congenital communications associated 
pulmonary arterial hypertension, lungs studied 
histologically . each, additional element pulmonary 
venous obstruction . likely absence pulmonary 
venous obstruction, adult patients congenital 
communication developed plexiform lesions . 
  three adult patients study, plexiform lesions 
identified . among 36 infants children, one subject showed 
plexiform lesions, 53-day-old girl mitral atresia, ventricular 
septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus . 
  findings three adult subjects support theory 
regarding genesis plexiform lesions, findings one 
infant plexiform lesions appear contradict .
