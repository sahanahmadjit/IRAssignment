basal metabolic rate cardiovascular surgery . 
  basal metabolic rate respiratory equivalent patients 
determined 8 days convalescence cardiovascular surgical 
operations performed without cardiopulmonary bypass . 
results compared patients undergone operation 
different diseases . metabolic rate majority cases 
increased commensurate body temperature . patients, 
particularly requiring open operation aortic valve, 
raised metabolic rates explained solely pyrexia . 
  types patients series elevated respiratory 
equivalents persisted throughout convalescence . equivalents 
greater patients treated cardiopulmonary bypass 
patients treated without bypass .
