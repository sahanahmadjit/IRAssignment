  central areas lung affected somewhat differently . 
3 days infection, nonciliated bronchiolar cells showed 
considerable hyperplasia endoplasmic reticulum apical cytoplasmic 
edema . viral particles matured lumen surface cells 
released bronchiolar lumen . bronchiolar cells, 
ciliated nonciliated, underwent degeneration sloughed 
bronchiolar lumen . regenerating epithelium stratified, 
surface cells elongated flattened . peribronchiolar 
interstitial tissue gradually became totally infiltrated cells, 
mostly mononuclear type .
