etude radiographique des genoux de 100 hemophiles 
de 7 15 ans 
radiographic examination knee syste- 
matically performed 100 haemophiliac subjects 
aged 7 15 years, 64 bilateral 
haemarthrosis, 30 one knee affected 
6 uninjured. 
intra-articular opacification, observed 
29 knees, corresponded recent haemarthrosis. 
densification synovial membrane ob- 
served 25 knees corresponded iron 
deposits. 
interlinear pinch present 52 knees. 
erosions articular surfaces especially fre- 
quent (78 knees) homogeneous (28 knees). 
hypertrophy condyles knee-caps, broadening 
intercondylian space, crushing internal tibial 
disk, genu valgum posterior subluxation tibia 
osseous deformations encountered. 
atrophy femur diaphysis explains frequency 
fracture femur. 
aspects seem occur early (inter- 
linear pinch, erosion surfaces), others 
tardier (geodes, decalcification). 
relation intensity abnormal radio- 
logical findings severity sequelae 
always exist, one can observe major radio- 
logical alterations major bio- 
logical disturbance.
