  total urinary gonadotrophin output group post menopausal 
women metastatic breast carcinoma undergoing hormone therapy, 
every case initially consisted treatment diethylstilboestrol, 
des (ca. 20 mg/d), studied periods varying seven 
months 31/2 years . 
  correlation gonadotrophin output clinical response 
found, except cases showing objective regression urinary 
gonadotrophin remained low throughout remission period . low level 
gonadotrophin output not, however, necessarily indicative 
good clinical remission . following withdrawal des, independent 
period therapy, recovery pre-treatment levels rule 
rather exception . 
  small group patients maintained lower dose des (3-5 mg/d) 
showed degree suppression urinary output 
receiving 20 mg/d, several exhibited objective remissions .
