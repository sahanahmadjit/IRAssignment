histological study liver hepatitis infants (japanese). 
clinical observations histological studies 
liver biopsy hepatitis infancy, 
i. e. obstructive jaundice unknown cause 
infants, made.  histologically, 
hepatitis infancy divisible 3 types: 
(1) giant cell formation observed. 
general, slight degeneration liver 
cells, necrosis inflammatory 
changes stasis bile characteristic. 
(2) so-called giant cell hepatitis 
characteristic.  (3) specific type, presenting 
picture cholangiolitis. 
histological changes liver biliary 
stasis scanty.  specific 
changes clinically differentiate 
3 types found.  type, 
serum bilirubin, sgot sgpt activities 
slight characteristic points clinical 
laboratory studies.  type 1, values 
relatively low, type 
2 markedly high.  type 3, sgot activity 
within normal range.  histological 
characteristics liver type 1 
necrosis liver cells, formation 
acidophilic granules balloon cells, 
cellular infiltration glisson's capsule, 
biliary stasis liver cells 
fine bile ducts.  morphologically, findings 
viral hepatitis observed.  type 
2 liver tissue replaced many 
multinuclear giant cells.  extreme distortion 
cords liver cells cellular infiltration 
glisson's capsule lobules 
noted.  marked biliary 
stasis capillary bile ducts liver cells. 
characteristic proliferation 
bile ducts bile plugs found, 
consistent giant 
cell hepatitis craing-landing.  type 3, degeneration 
liver cells, necrosis 
inflammatory changes slight.  biliary 
stasis hepatic lobules conspicuous. 
histological findings similar cholangiolitic 
hepatitis due drug poisoning 
observed.
