study direction inscription vectorcardiographic 
t-loop left right ventricular hypertrophy . 
  (1) frank lead vectorcardiogram recorded 30 normal persons 
323 cases hypertension acquired congenital heart disease 
t-loop classified 8 types according directions 
inscription 3 planar projections . frequently observed types 
examined direction maximal t vector . 
  (2) majority normal cases, t-loop inscribed 
counterclockwise horizontal clockwise sagittal planes . 
  (3) left ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal inscription 
t-loop observed abnormal rightward superior deviation 
maximal vector t-loop oriented 120 horizontal 
plane usually accompanied abnormal inscription . percentage 
abnormal inscription higher cases cardiac complaints . 
  (4) right ventricular hypertrophy, directional change t-loop 
relatively small changes inscription common . 
t-loop always inscribed abnormally cases abnormal 
inscription qrs-loop . 
  (5) concept polar vector found valuable 
studying inscription direction t-loop . significance 
changes inscription t-loop discussed .
