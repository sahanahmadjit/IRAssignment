fragments 20 human lung cancers studied . study included 
cancer-bearing tissue explants cases noncancerbearing lung 
tissue 4 20 cases . five major categories lymphocytic 
behavior derived study, namely.. (1) emigration 
migration lymphocytes explant,. (2) clustering 
lymphocytes around /target/ cells,. (3) ameboid transformation 
lymphocytes,. (4) lymphocytic congregation,. (5) emperipolesis . 
criteria different lymphocytic activities amplified 
introduced . 
  findings particular interest were.. (1) frequency via 
ble nonviable lymphocytes within vacuoles cells . 
observation considered absolute criterion recogni- 
tion emperipolesis . subsequent /inclusionbody/ appearance 
dead lymphocytes observed . (2) intimate relationship 
ameboid forms lymphocytes selected cells, resulting
