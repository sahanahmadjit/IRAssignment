loud, systolic murmur, characteristic ventricular 
septal defect, noted dur- 
ing infancy, whereas evidences aortic regurgitation 
(protodiastolic murmur

years age.  clinical catheterization data indicate 
principal hemody- 
namic load aortic regurgitation, whereas 
ventricular septal defect 
usually result large pulmonary blood flow 
high pulmonary arterial pressure. 
50% patients, significant pressure 
gradient across right ven- 
tricular outflow tract exists.  detailed pathologic 
studies indicate ventricular

membranous bulbar septum.  right coronary 
cusp one severely 
involved, and, prolapse, causes aortic 
regurgitation; noncoronary cusp 
always less severely affected.  anatomic basis 
pressure gradient ob- 
served across right ventricular outflow tract 
always clear.
