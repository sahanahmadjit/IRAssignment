uptake, inhibitory action l cell proliferation uncoupling 
oxidative phosphorylation, following results obtained 
  compound lipids (lysophosphatide rich fraction) isolated 
x-ray irradiated rabbit organ found possess strong 
hemolytic action also action inhibit cell proliferation 
well accelerate respiration mitochondria rabbit 
liver spleen . also proven act induce 
marked swelling mitochondria, impede formation high energy

various organs, marked uptake observed spleen, bone 
marrow, liver irradiated non-irradiated groups . 
further, uptake p -labeled compound lipids rabbits given 
intravenous injections compound lipid fraction 30 consecutive 
days previously found greatest pancreas followed 
bone marrow, spleen, liver order mentioned male group, whereas 
greatest spleen, followed liver bone marrow 
female group .
