c-acetyl bovine growth hormone 
procedure described labeling bovine growth hormone 
human albumin c-acetylation.  labeled molecule 
biologically antigenically similar unlabeled bovine 
growth hormone.  following administration labeled 
hormone animals, label appeared remain attached 
growth hormone molecule least 4 hours.  administra- 
tion labeled hormone promoted growth hypophysec- 
tomized rats increased free fatty acid concentration 
rabbit serum degree comparable seen following 
administration unlabeled growth hormone.  rabbit anti- 
bovine growth hormone serum neutralized rat growth 
response acetylated hormone, immunized rabbits 
altered isotope dilution increase serum free fatty 
acids intravenous injection labeled hormone.
