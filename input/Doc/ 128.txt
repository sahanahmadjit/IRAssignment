nickel carbonyl.. detection potential formation . 
  recent recommendations control nickel carbonyl exposures 
considered design simple, sensitive field method 
sampling nickel carbonyl air process gases . method involves 
collection dilute aqueous hcl, ph adjustment, nickel complex 
development alpha-furildioxime, extraction chloroform . 
color intensity compared visually (or greater accuracy, 
spectrophotometrically) liquid standards . sensitivities 
order 0.001 ppm obtainable . detailed development 
thermodynamics associated formation nickel carbonyl also 
presented show maximum concentrations nickel carbonyl may 
formed wide range co concentrations, temperatures
