color test measurement antibody t-strain mycoplasmas. 
   metabolic inhibition technique measurement 
antibody t-strain mycoplasmas developed, 
based upon ability t-strain mycoplasmas 
metabolize urea concomitant production ammonia, 
ability specific, antiserum inhibit 
ammonia production.  phenol red added 
medium served indicator ph change resulting 
ammonia production.  specific antiserum t-strain 
mycoplasma t-960 prepared.  t-strain 
organism shown serologically distinct 
recognized large-colony mycoplasmas.  antibody 
mycoplasma strain t-960 human sera demonstrated 
metabolic inhibition technique.
