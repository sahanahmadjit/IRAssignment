autoradiographic study cell migration eye lens epithelium 
normal alloxan diabetic rats . 
  lenses normal alloxan diabetic rats without cataract 
investigated autoradiography 4 hours, 4 days 8 days 
intraperitoneal injection h3-thymidine (0.4 uc/g body weight) . 
rats made diabetic 8 days prior injection thymidine 
age 4 weeks . position labelled nuclei lens epithelium 
noted grain numbers counted . diabetic rats 
lower frequency labelled nuclei controls 4 hours 
grain counts equal . frequency diagrams labelled nuclei 
given three experimental periods . predominant 
peak appears 4 hours distance 30-60 cells front 
beginning nuclear arc . successive shift towards area 
observed longer experimental periods . shift peaks 
restricted diabetic animals . result may best 
interpreted effect increased time cell generation .
