lactate pyruvate brain rats hyperventilation . 
  experiments anesthetized curarized rats artificial 
ventilation show hyperventilation lactate pyruvate 
markedly increased blood brain . lactate/pyruvate 
ratio remains blood control conditions, 
systematically decreased brain . hypoxia (ventilation 7 
oxygen nitrogen) lactate rises markedly blood brain . 
lactate/pyruvate ratio strongly increased blood shows 
small rise brain . observations indicate different 
mechanism responsible rise lactate brain hypoxia 
hyperventilation . important augmentation lactate brain 
hyperventilation can give explanation delayed rise
