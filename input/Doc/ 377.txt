comparative study made effects several cytotoxic agents, given 
maximally tolerable doses, primary agglutinin response rats 
immunized sheep erythrocytes given intraperitoneally.  antigen given 
before, beginning, middle 5-day course drug 
treatment.  chlormethine (mechlorethamine), 5-fluorouracil, 
5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine suppress primary response 
significantly.  methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-mercaptopurine roboside

immunization performed one three days prior 
drug treatment.  vinblastine affect peak titer, prolong 
induction time antigen given 2 days prior drug treatment. 
cyclophosphamide markedly prolonged induction time suppressed peak titer 
irrespective time antigen administration.  antimetabolites 
appeared suppress maximally intermediate stage primary response. 
cyclophosphamide appeared suppress stages.
