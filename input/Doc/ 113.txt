  60 necropsied cases single common ventricle man, four 
major unrelated ventricular malformations found.. (1) absence 
right ventricular sinus, 47 cases (78 percent), designated type 
a,. (2) absence left ventricular sinus, 3 cases (5 percent), 
type b,. (3) absence rudimentary development ventricular 
septum, 4 cases (7 percent), type c,. (4) absence 
ventricular sinuses ventricular septum, 6 cases (10 
percent), type d .

normal (solitus) interrelationship, 9 cases (15 percent), 
designated type 1,. d-transposition, transposed aortic valve lying 
right (dextro, d), relative transposed pulmonary valve, 
25 cases (42 percent), type ii,. l-transposition, transposed 
aortic valve lying left (levo l), relative transposed 
pulmonary valve, 26 cases (43 percent), type iii . none
