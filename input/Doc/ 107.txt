disturbances verbal body image.. particular syndrome sensory 
aphasia . 
  1. pto syndrome dominant hemisphere varies according 
extent depth lesion angular supramarginal areas . 
mildest clinical syndrome consists vague contralateral sensory 
impairment associated dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyslexia 
difficulty naming . extensive lesion needed cause 
wide variety classical signs described parietal lobe disease, 
among gerstmann's syndrome, usually found 
association manifestations parietal loss (case 1) . 
even extensive corticosubcortical lesion area leads 
complete disintegration naming understanding speech (cases 3, 
4 5) . 
  2. attention drawn difficulties arising lack 
differentiation concrete gnostic body image abstract 
verbal body image investigation patients . aphasic 
syndrome differentiated disturbances gnosis 
application separate, non-verbal methods testing elicit 
impairment gnostic body image . latter may well 
compensated apparently unimpaired presence 
aphasic syndrome limited verbal body image . 
  3. disturbances speech pto lesions investigated along 
quantitative scales impairment repetition, understanding 
naming, show regular interrelation . nomination affected, 
understanding less affected . repetition best preserved 
function (cases 1-4) . interrelation functions 
found regard verbal body image . however, understanding 
naming parts body show far greater disintegration 
understanding naming categories words (all cases 
presented here) . aphasic syndrome subsiding, finger aphasia 
minor disturbances verbal body image associated 
acalculia may persist (case 1) . thus gerstmann's /finger agnosia/ may 
represent partial impairment verbal body image limited 
finger aphasia . 
  4. assumed verbal body image differs 
categories verbal symbols owing mainly proprioceptive, 
vestibular tactile experience forming specific physiologic 
background . telereceptive experience minor importance 
initial development understanding words defining body 
image . 
  patients described here, selectively worse aphasic 
impairment verbal body image, compared categories 
words, seem confirm assumption .
